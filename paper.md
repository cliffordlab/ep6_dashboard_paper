# Summary

At Executive Park 6, we developed a low-cost indoor monitoring system preserving the privacy using Raspberry Pi 4, Respeaker USB microphone array, Raspberry Pi Camera and Google Coral USB TPU for people sufferingfrom cognitive impairment diseases like Dementia, Alzheimer's disease etc. with their privacy presevered. With custom real-time algorithms, we detect the position of participants and try to assess their engagement with each other through poses. To collate all the data and effective monitoring, we developed `EP6 Dashboard` which helps combining all the data from Audio, Camera and Bluetooth pipelines together and presents the analysis of this data using Computer Vision, Signal Processing and Machine Learning Techniques. `EP6 Dashboard` is one stop solution for monitoring the sensor network, analyzing and visualizing the multimodal data collected.

# Statement of need

As detection techniques have improved over the years, Alzheimer's and other different forms of dementia have come to receive an increasing amount of attention. In addition to being the sixth most common cause of mortality in the US, Alzheimer's disease is also thought to be the possible cause of dementia in more than 6 million people. While the average person experiences a natural reduction in cognitive function with aging, some people experience a far more rapid decline, which frequently progresses to Alzheimer's disease or another form of dementia. These people are classified as having mild cognitive impairment, making them the study's population.


`EP6 Dashboard` is an unified portal developed using python packages and React framework to monitor the indoor activities through audio, visual and spatial tracking. 



# System Architecture 

To implement the aforementioned system, we have followed a scalable three tier architecture using Flask as application server hosted with nginx as load balancer and reverse proxy. Frontend is designed with React for and served through nginx as webserver. We are using influxdb as database for storing the time series data generated by the edge devices. Redis is used as key-value store to interact with background python processes, whose output is consumed on the dashboard. MySQL database is used for storing the authentication and authorization of users.

# Monitoring the Sensor Network

For a distributed sensor network application like this, it becomes very important to ensure that all of the sensors are working faithfully and recording the data. To ensure this, we developed a robust mechanism to check the health of each of the Raspberry Pi and sensors mounted to it. The results from this upstream system is sourced to the dashboard. 

Section A) in fig. II represents position of each Raspberry Pi on EP6 schematic with region monitored by them. If clicked on a particular region, it shows the status of sensors connected to that Raspberry Pi as shown in section C) of fig. II. Lastly, table shown in section B) of fig. II represents the list of all Raspberry Pi in EP6 with their status and an option to reboot them remotely.

# Mathematics

Single dollars ($) are required for inline mathematics e.g. $f(x) = e^{\pi/x}$

Double dollars make self-standing equations:

$$\Theta(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{l}
0\textrm{ if } x < 0\cr
1\textrm{ else}
\end{array}\right.$$

You can also use plain \LaTeX for equations
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fourier}
\hat f(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{i\omega x} dx
\end{equation}
and refer to \autoref{eq:fourier} from text.

# Citations

Citations to entries in paper.bib should be in
[rMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html)
format.

If you want to cite a software repository URL (e.g. something on GitHub without a preferred
citation) then you can do it with the example BibTeX entry below for @fidgit.

For a quick reference, the following citation commands can be used:
- `@author:2001`  ->  "Author et al. (2001)"
- `[@author:2001]` -> "(Author et al., 2001)"
- `[@author1:2001; @author2:2001]` -> "(Author1 et al., 2001; Author2 et al., 2002)"

# Figures

Figures can be included like this:
![Caption for example figure.\label{fig:example}](figure.png)
and referenced from text using \autoref{fig:example}.

Figure sizes can be customized by adding an optional second parameter:
![Caption for example figure.](figure.png){ width=20% }
