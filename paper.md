# Summary

At Executive Park 6, we developed a low-cost indoor monitoring system preserving the privacy using Raspberry Pi 4, Respeaker USB microphone array, Raspberry Pi Camera and Google Coral USB TPU for people sufferingfrom cognitive impairment diseases like Dementia, Alzheimer's disease etc. with their privacy presevered. With custom real-time algorithms, we detect the position of participants and try to assess their engagement with each other through poses. To collate all the data and effective monitoring, we developed `EP6 Dashboard` which helps combining all the data from Audio, Camera and Bluetooth pipelines together and presents the analysis of this data using Computer Vision, Signal Processing and Machine Learning Techniques. `EP6 Dashboard` is one stop solution for monitoring the sensor network, analyzing and visualizing the multimodal data collected.

# Statement of need

As detection techniques have improved over the years, Alzheimer's and other different forms of dementia have come to receive an increasing amount of attention. In addition to being the sixth most common cause of mortality in the US, Alzheimer's disease is also thought to be the possible cause of dementia in more than 6 million people. While the average person experiences a natural reduction in cognitive function with aging, some people experience a far more rapid decline, which frequently progresses to Alzheimer's disease or another form of dementia. These people are classified as having mild cognitive impairment, making them the study's population.


`EP6 Dashboard` is an unified portal developed using python packages and React framework to monitor the indoor activities through audio, visual and spatial tracking. It monitors following activities:
a) Audio
b) Visual
c) Indoor Temperature and Humidity
d) Bluetooth


# System Architecture 

To implement the aforementioned system, we have followed a scalable three tier architecture using Flask as application server hosted with nginx as load balancer and reverse proxy. Frontend is designed with React for and served through nginx as webserver. We are using influxdb as database for storing the time series data generated by the edge devices. Redis is used as key-value store to interact with background python processes, whose output is consumed on the dashboard. MySQL database is used for storing the authentication and authorization of users.

# Monitoring the Sensor Network

For a distributed sensor network application like this, it becomes very important to ensure that all of the sensors are working faithfully and recording the data. To ensure this, we developed a robust mechanism to check the health of each of the Raspberry Pi and sensors mounted to it. The results from this upstream system is sourced to the dashboard. 

Section A) in fig. II represents position of each Raspberry Pi on EP6 schematic with region monitored by them. If clicked on a particular region, it shows the status of sensors connected to that Raspberry Pi as shown in section C) of fig. II. Lastly, table shown in section B) of fig. II represents the list of all Raspberry Pi in EP6 with their status and an option to reboot them remotely.

# Audio Pipeline Analysis

As part of audio pipeline, we collect the audio features of the participants through respeaker USB microphone arrays placed on ceiling. We don't store the audio itself but its computed feature to preserve participant privacy. Through these features, we perform speaker diarization followed by tagging the respective participants groups. Through these, we are measuring the degree of engagement in each group. 

Occupancy analysis plays an important role in identification of how physical location of the EP6 correlates with the interaction among the participants. fig. III represents the image of Audio section on EP6 dashboard. Section A) shows the physical location of microphone arrays in the EP6 lab. To have an hour dependent view of occupancy, we also plot the heatmap of occupancy based on the audio signals as shown in section C) which can be controlled through slider shown in section B) of fig. III. One can vary the hours and see the occupancy change with respect to hours.
